        <p>In this webpage, I will write summaries for all of the games and describe other important attributes of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. The series has grown quite large, and it can be overwhelming for those who are just now trying to get into it. Each page of my site can focus on one of the games in the franchise, and will contain details regarding the events that transpire in each game. This will total up to several pages, likely around 8 or 10. If this becomes too great a feat for me to tackle, I will condense it down into at least four pages as instructed.</p>
